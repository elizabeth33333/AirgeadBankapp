This project is a C++ program designed to assist users in calculating and visualizing the growth of their investments over time. It allows users to input parameters such as the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years for investment. The program then calculates and displays two charts: one showing the earned amount of interest, and the other showing the balance of the account, both with and without additional monthly deposits.

What the project is solving:
The project helps users plan and visualize the growth of their investments, taking into account both one-time initial investments and regular monthly deposits. It provides valuable financial information, which can be essential for making informed investment decisions.

What was done well:
The code is structured into a class-based approach, which promotes modularity and reusability.
Error handling is implemented to ensure that the user enters valid input and to provide helpful error messages.
The program uses clear and concise variable and function names, making the code readable and maintainable.
The program separates the user interface logic from the financial calculations, improving code organization.

Where enhancements can be made:
The program could benefit from additional user interface improvements, such as more user-friendly prompts, clear instructions, and a more visually appealing output.
The code could include comments explaining the purpose of the various class members and functions for better documentation.
It's important to validate the user's input further, such as ensuring that interest rates are within a reasonable range (e.g., not negative or extremely high).
Consider implementing exception handling to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

Challenging parts of the code:
One challenge for me in making this code was knowing what functions to use to achieve my desired effect. I had to look up a bunch of terms and had to keep referencing myself to them to make sure I knew how to implement them. Running the code multiple times helped me in understanding and fixing what I got right or wrong. Making sure everything ran smoothly without any bugs/errors was unsurprisingly the most challenging part of this prooject.

Transferable skills:
Skills transferable from this project to other projects or coursework include:
Object-oriented programming principles and class design, input validation and error handling, modular and structured code organization, formatting and output for presenting data, and using loops and conditional statements effectively.

Maintainability, readability, and adaptability:
To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, the following practices were used:
Meaningful variable and function names, consistent code formatting and indentation, clear separation of concerns between user interface and calculations, use of functions and methods to encapsulate specific functionality, use of comments to explain the purpose of functions and code sections, and the use of a class-based structure allows for easy extension with additional features or calculations.
